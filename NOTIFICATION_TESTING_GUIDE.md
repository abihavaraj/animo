# üì± Push Notification Testing Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CURRENT ISSUE: Expo Go Limitations**

WARN expo-notifications: Android Push notifications (remote notifications) functionality provided by expo-notifications was removed from Expo Go with the release of SDK 53. Use a development build instead of Expo Go.
```

## üîß **IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS:**

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Build development version
eas build --platform android --profile development
# OR for iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile development
```

- Terminal shows: `‚úÖ [joinWaitlist] Translated waitlist notification created`

- The issue is just Expo Go can't display them

3. **Verify entries** have Albanian translations in `title` and `message`

### **Test Translation Service Directly:**
Let me create a test component to verify translations work:
