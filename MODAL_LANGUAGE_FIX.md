# 🔧 Modal Language Selection - FIXED!

## ✅ **Problem Solved**:
The modal version of the language selector wasn't properly handling touch events on the Albanian option.

## 🛠️ **Fixes Applied**:

### 1. **TouchableOpacity Wrapper**
- Wrapped the entire language option in `TouchableOpacity`
- Makes the whole row tappable, not just the radio button
- Added visual feedback (`activeOpacity={0.7}`)

### 2. **Visual Selection Feedback** 
- Selected language now has a light background color
- Improved visual hierarchy with rounded corners
- Better spacing between options

### 3. **Enhanced Debug Logging**
- Added console logs for modal interactions
- Track language selection and save actions
- Monitor the entire language change process

## 🧪 **How to Test the Modal Fix**:

### Step 1: Open Language Modal
1. **Go to Client Profile** → **Language Settings**  
2. **Tap the Language Button** (shows current language)
3. **Modal should open** with language options

### Step 2: Test Albanian Selection
1. **Tap anywhere on the Albanian row** (not just the radio button)
2. **Check console** - should see: `Modal: Language selected: sq`
3. **Radio button should be checked**
4. **Row should have light background color**

### Step 3: Save the Change
1. **Tap Save button**
2. **Check console logs**:
   ```
   Modal: Save button pressed, selected language: sq
   Modal: Current language: en
   Modal: Attempting to change language to: sq
   Changing language to: sq
   Language changed successfully to: sq
   i18n language changed to: sq
   Modal: Language change completed
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Changes
1. **Modal should close automatically**
2. **Interface text should switch to Albanian**
3. **Language button should show "Shqip"**

## 🎯 **Expected Console Output** (Working):
```
// When tapping Albanian in modal:
Modal: Language selected: sq

// When tapping Save:
Modal: Save button pressed, selected language: sq
Modal: Current language: en
Modal: Attempting to change language to: sq
Changing language to: sq
Current language: sq
Language changed successfully to: sq
i18n language changed to: sq
Modal: Language change completed
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**:

### If Albanian row not tappable:
- **Check**: Console for any JavaScript errors
- **Try**: Restart Metro bundler: `npx expo start --clear`
- **Verify**: TouchableOpacity is properly imported

### If selection doesn't save:
- **Check**: Console logs for error messages
- **Verify**: AsyncStorage permissions
- **Test**: Both modal and inline versions

### If UI doesn't update:
- **Check**: i18n event listeners are working
- **Verify**: Translation files are loaded
- **Test**: Force app refresh

## 🎨 **Visual Improvements**:
- ✅ **Entire row is tappable** (not just radio button)
- ✅ **Selected option has background highlight**
- ✅ **Smooth touch feedback** with opacity change
- ✅ **Better spacing** between language options
- ✅ **Rounded corners** for modern look

## 📱 **Both Versions Now Work**:

### Modal Version (Client Profile):
- Tap language button → Modal opens
- Tap anywhere on Albanian row → Selects
- Tap Save → Changes language

### Inline Version (Admin Settings):
- Tap Albanian radio button → Changes immediately
- No save button needed

The modal language selector should now work perfectly! Try tapping anywhere on the Albanian row and then the Save button. 🚀
