# Bar Portal Date Filter Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Yesterday Filter Not Working in Reports
**Problem:** When clicking the "yesterday" filter in the Reports tab, it didn't show yesterday's data.

**Root Cause:** The `loadSales()` function was only fetching today's sales using `barService.getTodaySales()`, so there was no yesterday data to filter.

**Solution:** Modified `loadSales()` to fetch the last 3 months of sales data, allowing all date filters (yesterday, week, month, custom) to work properly.

```javascript
const loadSales = async () => {
  // Load all sales (or at least last 3 months) to enable filtering
  try {
    const threeMonthsAgo = new Date();
    threeMonthsAgo.setMonth(threeMonthsAgo.getMonth() - 3);
    
    const { data, error } = await barSupabase
      .from('bar_sales')
      .select('*')
      .gte('sale_date', threeMonthsAgo.toISOString())
      .order('sale_date', { ascending: false });
    
    if (error) throw error;
    setSales(data || []);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading sales:', error);
    setSales([]);
  }
};
```

### 2. No Date Filter on Sales Tab
**Problem:** The Sales tab had no date filtering - it just showed all sales.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive date filtering to the Sales tab with:
- Filter options: All, Today, Yesterday, Week, Month, Custom
- Custom date range picker (start and end dates)
- Sales summary showing filtered count and total revenue
- Empty state when no sales match the filter

**Features Added:**
- Date filter UI matching the Reports tab design
- Real-time filtering of sales based on selected date range
- Summary card showing:
  - Number of sales in filtered period
  - Total revenue for filtered period
- Empty state message when no sales found

## Files Modified

1. **src/screens/reception/BarPortalWeb.tsx**
   - Updated `loadSales()` to fetch 3 months of sales data
   - Added sales date filter states (`salesDateFilter`, `salesCustomStartDate`, `salesCustomEndDate`)
   - Created `getFilteredSalesForTab()` function for sales tab filtering
   - Added date filter UI to Sales tab
   - Added sales summary card showing filtered results

   - **Week**: Last 7 days
   - **Month**: Last 30 days
