# iOS Push Notification Fix for Production IPA Files

## Problem Identified
Your push notifications work in development but not in production IPA builds because of APNs environment configuration issues.

## Root Cause
1. **APNs Environment**: Your app.json was configured for `development` APNs environment instead of `production`
2. **Missing Production Credentials**: Production builds need proper Apple Push Notification certificates
3. **Build Configuration**: EAS build configuration wasn't optimized for production push notifications

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated app.json
✅ Changed APNs environment from `development` to `production`:
```json
"com.apple.developer.aps-environment": "production"
```

### 2. Updated eas.json
✅ Enhanced production build configuration:
```json
"production": {
  "autoIncrement": true,
  "distribution": "store",
  "ios": {
    "resourceClass": "m-medium",
    "buildConfiguration": "Release"
  },
  "android": {
    "resourceClass": "medium"
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Configure Push Notification Credentials
Run this command to set up production push notification credentials:
```bash
npx eas credentials
```
- Select **iOS**
- Select **production** profile
- Choose **Push Notifications** 
- Follow prompts to upload/generate production push certificate

### 2. Rebuild Production IPA
After configuring credentials, rebuild your production IPA:
```bash
npx eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

### 3. Verify Expo Project Configuration
Make sure your Expo project has the correct push notification service configured:
```bash
npx expo install expo-notifications
```

## Important Notes

### For Development vs Production
- **Development builds**: Use development APNs environment and development certificates
- **Production builds**: Use production APNs environment and production certificates
- **The environment in app.json should match your build type**

### Apple Developer Account Requirements
For production push notifications, you need:
1. Valid Apple Developer Account ($99/year)
2. Production Push Notification Certificate or Apple Push Notification Auth Key
3. Proper provisioning profile for production

### Testing Production Push Notifications
1. Install the production IPA on a physical device
2. The device must be signed into an Apple ID
3. Notifications should now work with the production APNs environment

## Troubleshooting

### If notifications still don't work after rebuild:
1. Check Apple Developer Console for certificate issues
2. Verify the bundle identifier matches your Apple Developer account
3. Ensure the device has proper network connectivity
4. Check iOS notification settings for your app

### Common Issues:
- **"Invalid APNs Certificate"**: Certificate expired or wrong environment
- **"DeviceNotRegistered"**: Device token not properly registered with APNs
- **"BadDeviceToken"**: Token generated for wrong environment (dev vs prod)

## Current Log Analysis
Your logs show:
- ✅ Permissions granted correctly
- ✅ Expo push token generated successfully  
- ✅ Notifications sent to Expo servers successfully
- ❌ Notifications not delivered to device (APNs environment mismatch)

After applying these fixes and rebuilding, your push notifications should work in production IPA files.
