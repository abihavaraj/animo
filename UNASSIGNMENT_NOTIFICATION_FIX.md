# Unassignment Notification Bug Fix ‚úÖ

## Problem
User **argjend@argjend.com** received a push notification saying they were unassigned from a class, even though they were NOT in that class.

## Root Cause
When reception unassigns a client from a class:
1. The booking object comes from **React state** (loaded once and cached)
2. This cached booking might have **stale/old data** 
3. Notification was sent to `booking.user_id` from this stale object
4. Result: **Wrong user received the notification**

## Solution Implemented

### Changed Logic:
**BEFORE (Wrong)**:
```typescript
// Used user_id from potentially stale React state
const removedUserId = booking.user_id; 
await notificationService.sendPushNotificationToUser(removedUserId, ...);
```

**AFTER (Correct)**:
```typescript
// Fetch fresh booking from database
const { data: actualBooking } = await supabase
  .from('bookings')
  .select('user_id, users(id, name, email)')
  .eq('id', booking.id)
  .eq('class_id', classId)
  .eq('status', 'cancelled')  // Already cancelled at this point
  .single();

// Use user_id from FRESH database record
const removedUserId = actualBooking.user_id;
await notificationService.sendPushNotificationToUser(removedUserId, ...);
```

### Why This Works:
1. ‚úÖ Booking is cancelled first in database
2. ‚úÖ Then we fetch the **actual cancelled booking** from DB
3. ‚úÖ We get the **real user_id** who was removed
4. ‚úÖ Notification goes to the **correct user** based on DB truth, not stale state

## Files Modified
- `src/screens/admin/PCClassManagement.tsx`
  - Fixed `performRemoveClient()` function (line ~2354)
  - Fixed `performUnassignClient()` function (line ~2620)
- `src/services/bookingService.ts`
  - Added debug logging

## How to Verify Fix

1. Have a class with:
   - User A (confirmed booking)
   - User B (waitlist position 1)
   - User C (waitlist position 2)
   - User D (not in class at all)

2. Unassign User A from the class

3. Expected Results:
   - ‚úÖ User A gets "unassigned" notification
   - ‚úÖ User B gets "promoted from waitlist" notification
   - ‚úÖ User C moves to position 1
   - ‚ùå User D gets **NO notification** (this was the bug)

## Technical Details

The fix uses the **booking ID** as the source of truth:
- Booking ID never changes during the operation
- After cancellation, booking has `status='cancelled'`
- We query: "Get me the booking with this ID that was just cancelled"
- The `user_id` in that record is the correct user who was removed

This pattern ensures we're always using **database truth** instead of **UI state** for critical operations like notifications.

## No More Ghost Notifications! üëª‚ùå

Users will no longer receive notifications for classes they're not even enrolled in.
