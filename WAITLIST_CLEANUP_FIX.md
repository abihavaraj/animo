# Waitlist Cleanup Fix - Reception Dashboard

## Problem Fixed ✅

**Issue:** Reception dashboard was showing **past/expired waitlist entries** when clicking "This Week Waitlist"
- Example: Waitlist entry from `2025-10-01` (past date) was showing in current week view
- The "week" filter was showing ALL waitlist data including past classes
- Reception couldn't see what's actually relevant for current operations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Reception Dashboard Waitlist Filtering

**File:** `src/screens/ReceptionDashboardWeb.tsx`

**Changes Made:**

#### A. Filter Out Past Waitlist Entries (Lines 1015-1030)
```typescript
// 🚀 FIX: Always filter out past/expired waitlist entries
const activewaitlistData = rawWaitlistData.filter((waitlistEntry: any) => {
  const classDate = waitlistEntry.classes?.date;
  const classTime = waitlistEntry.classes?.time;
  
  if (!classDate) return false;
  
  // Check if class has already started
  if (classTime) {
    const classDateTime = new Date(`${classDate}T${classTime}`);
    return classDateTime > now; // Only show waitlist for future classes
  }
  
  // If no time, just check date
  return classDate >= today;
});
```

#### B. Fixed "This Week" Filter (Lines 1048-1058)
**Before:**
```typescript
} else {
  filteredWaitlist = rawWaitlistData;  // ❌ Shows ALL past data!
  title = 'All Waitlist Entries';
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
} else {
  // 🚀 FIX: For 'week', show only this week's waitlist
  const endOfWeek = new Date();
  endOfWeek.setDate(endOfWeek.getDate() + (7 - endOfWeek.getDay())); // Sunday
  const endOfWeekStr = endOfWeek.toISOString().split('T')[0];
  
  filteredWaitlist = activewaitlistData.filter((waitlistEntry: any) => {
    const classDate = waitlistEntry.classes?.date;
    return classDate >= today && classDate <= endOfWeekStr;
  });
  title = 'Waitlist This Week';
}
```

#### C. Fixed Waitlist Count Display (Lines 1439-1509)
- Waitlist counts now exclude past entries
- "Today", "Tomorrow", and "This Week" filters all show accurate active waitlist counts
- No more misleading numbers from expired entries

---

## Current Behavior (After Fix)

### Reception Dashboard - Waitlist Views:

1. **"Today" Filter:**
   - Shows waitlist for TODAY's classes only
   - Only includes classes that haven't started yet
   - ✅ Past classes are excluded

2. **"Tomorrow" Filter:**
   - Shows waitlist for TOMORROW's classes
   - ✅ All entries are future by definition

3. **"This Week" Filter:**
   - Shows waitlist for classes from TODAY to END OF WEEK (Sunday)
   - ✅ Past classes are excluded
   - ✅ Only shows active/relevant waitlists

### Waitlist Count Display:
- Shows accurate count of **active waitlists only**
- Past entries don't inflate the numbers
- Reception sees what's actually relevant

---

## Database Current State

### Waitlist Table Structure (Existing):
```sql
waitlist {
  id: uuid PRIMARY KEY
  user_id: uuid NOT NULL
  class_id: uuid NOT NULL
  position: integer NOT NULL
  created_at: timestamp DEFAULT now()
}
```

### Current Cleanup Strategy:
1. **Client-side removal** - Users automatically removed from expired waitlists
2. **Manual cleanup service** - Can delete old entries periodically
3. **❌ No status tracking** - Entries are deleted (no history preserved)

---

## Optional: Future Enhancement for Reporting

If you want to keep waitlist history for analytics/reporting, consider this enhancement:

### Add Status Field (Optional SQL Migration):

```sql
-- Add status column to waitlist table
ALTER TABLE waitlist 
ADD COLUMN status TEXT DEFAULT 'active' 
CHECK (status IN ('active', 'promoted', 'expired', 'cancelled'));

-- Add updated_at for tracking changes
ALTER TABLE waitlist 
ADD COLUMN updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW();

-- Add index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_waitlist_status ON waitlist(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_waitlist_class_status ON waitlist(class_id, status);

-- Update existing entries to 'active'
UPDATE waitlist SET status = 'active' WHERE status IS NULL;
```

### Status Types:
- **`active`** - Currently on waitlist, class hasn't started
- **`promoted`** - Successfully got a spot (set when promoted)
- **`expired`** - Class started but no spot opened (set automatically)
- **`cancelled`** - User manually left waitlist

### Benefits of Status Tracking:
1. **Reporting & Analytics**
   - Track waitlist conversion rates (promoted vs expired)
   - Identify popular classes that always have waitlists
   - Analyze which classes fill up vs have no-shows

2. **Historical Data**
   - Keep audit trail of all waitlist activity
   - Reception can see trends over time
   - No data loss for reporting

3. **Auto-Cleanup Function** (Example):
```typescript
// Automatically mark expired waitlists (run daily via cron)
async function markExpiredWaitlists() {
  const now = new Date().toISOString();
  
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('waitlist')
    .update({ 
      status: 'expired',
      updated_at: now 
    })
    .eq('status', 'active')
    .in('class_id', supabase
      .from('classes')
      .select('id')
      .lte('date', now.split('T')[0])
    );
  
  return { success: !error };
}
```

4. **Later Cleanup** (Delete old data after X months):
```sql
-- Delete waitlist entries older than 6 months
DELETE FROM waitlist 
WHERE status IN ('expired', 'cancelled', 'promoted')
AND updated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months';
```

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Reception Dashboard:
- [ ] Click "Today" waitlist - should show only today's active waitlists
- [ ] Click "Tomorrow" waitlist - should show only tomorrow's waitlists  
- [ ] Click "This Week" waitlist - should show only this week's active waitlists
- [ ] Verify past waitlist entries (like 2025-10-01) don't appear
- [ ] Verify waitlist counts are accurate (no past entries)

### ✅ User Side (Already Working):
- [ ] Users see only relevant waitlists on dashboard
- [ ] Past waitlists are auto-removed
- [ ] No impact on user experience

## Notes

- ✅ **No database changes required** - fix is view-layer only
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - no breaking changes
- ✅ **Performance impact** - minimal (client-side filtering)
- 📊 **Optional enhancement** - Add status field for better reporting (see above)
- 🔄 **Client cleanup** - Still works as before (removes past entries)
- 📈 **Reception view** - Now shows only relevant, active waitlists
