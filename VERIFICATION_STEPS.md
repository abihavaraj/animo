# Push Notification Verification Steps

## Current Issues Identified
- Your app is still generating development tokens: `Push Token (DEV): ExponentPushToken[...]`
- Need to configure production credentials and rebuild

## Step-by-Step Verification Process

### 1. Configure Production Push Credentials
```bash
npx eas credentials
```
**IMPORTANT:** When prompted:
- Select platform: **iOS**
- Select build profile: **production** (NOT development!)
- Select: **Push Notifications**
- Follow prompts to configure production certificate

### 2. Check Current Credentials Status
```bash
npx eas credentials --platform ios --profile production
```

### 3. Build Production IPA
```bash
npx eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

### 4. Install and Test
- Install the production IPA on your iPhone
- Test push notifications

## Expected Changes After Production Build

### Development vs Production Tokens
- **Development**: `Push Token (DEV): ExponentPushToken[...]`
- **Production**: `Push Token: ExponentPushToken[...]` (no DEV prefix)

### APNs Environment
- **Development**: Uses Apple's development push servers
- **Production**: Uses Apple's production push servers

## Quick Verification Commands

### Check if you have production credentials configured:
```bash
npx eas credentials --platform ios --profile production
```

### View all configured credentials:
```bash
npx eas credentials list
```

### Build production IPA:
```bash
npx eas build --platform ios --profile production --clear-cache
```

## Expected Results After Fixing

1. **Production build** should generate tokens without "(DEV)" prefix
2. **Push notifications** should be delivered to your iPhone
3. **Logs** should show successful delivery, not just successful sending

## Common Issues to Watch For

1. **No Production Certificate**: EAS will prompt you to create one
2. **Expired Certificate**: Renew in Apple Developer Console
3. **Wrong Bundle ID**: Must match your Apple Developer account
4. **Cache Issues**: Use `--clear-cache` flag when building

## Current Configuration Status
- ✅ APNs environment changed to "production" in app.json
- ✅ EAS production profile configured
- ⚠️ Still need to configure production push credentials
- ⚠️ Still need to rebuild with production profile
