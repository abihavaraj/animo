# Session Fixes Summary - October 3, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 🐛 Booking History - Missing Booked Classes

**Problem**: In the booking history screen, users could only see their waitlist entries but NOT their booked classes.

**Root Cause**: Line 480 in `BookingHistory.tsx` was filtering upcoming bookings to only show those from the **active subscription period**:
```typescript
const upcomingBookings = activeSubscriptionBookings.filter(booking => booking && isUpcoming(booking));
```

**Fix**: Changed to show ALL upcoming bookings regardless of subscription status:
```typescript
const upcomingBookings = safeBookings.filter(booking => booking && isUpcoming(booking));
```

**Impact**: Users can now see all their booked classes in the booking history, not just waitlist entries.

**File Modified**: `src/screens/client/BookingHistory.tsx`

### 2. 🔒 Logout Push Notification Security Fix

**Problem**: When users logged out, their device could still receive push notifications intended for the previously logged-in user. This was a **critical security and privacy issue** affecting all user roles (clients, instructors, admins, reception).

**Root Cause**: The logout function only cleared the `push_token` in the `users` table but did NOT deactivate tokens in the `push_tokens` table. Since `notificationService` sends to all tokens where `is_active = true`, logged-out devices continued receiving notifications.

**Fix**: Implemented complete 3-step push notification cleanup in the logout function:

1. **Clear legacy token** (users table):
   ```typescript
   await supabase
     .from('users')
     .update({ push_token: null })
     .eq('id', currentUser.id);
   ```

2. **🔒 Deactivate ALL tokens** (push_tokens table) - SECURITY FIX:
   ```typescript
   await supabaseAdmin
     .from('push_tokens')
     .update({ is_active: false })
     .eq('user_id', currentUser.id);
   ```

3. **Clear local service state**:
   ```typescript
   const { pushNotificationService } = await import('./pushNotificationService');
   pushNotificationService.clearToken();
   ```

**Security Benefits**:
- ✅ Users don't receive notifications for accounts they've logged out from
- ✅ Multi-device support with independent token management
- ✅ Shared device safety (important for reception staff)
- ✅ Role-based security for all user types

**Impact**: Critical security fix ensuring proper notification isolation between users on the same device.

**File Modified**: `src/services/authService.ts`

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenario 1: Booking History Display
1. Login as a client with booked classes
2. Navigate to Booking History
3. ✅ Verify that upcoming booked classes are displayed
4. ✅ Verify that waitlist entries are also displayed

### Test Scenario 2: Logout Notification Security
1. Login as User A on a device
2. Verify notifications work for User A
3. Logout User A
4. Login as User B on the same device
5. Send a test notification to User A
6. ✅ Verify the device does NOT receive User A's notification
7. Send a test notification to User B
8. ✅ Verify the device receives User B's notification

### Test Scenario 3: Multi-Device Logout
1. Login as User A on Device 1 and Device 2
2. Both devices should receive notifications
3. Logout User A from Device 1 only
4. Send notification to User A
5. ✅ Only Device 2 should receive the notification
