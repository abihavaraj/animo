      productSales[item.product_name] = {
        name: item.product_name,
        quantity: total quantity,
        revenue: total revenue
      };
    });
  });
  return sorted by revenue, top 5;
};

    if (target.tagName === 'INPUT' || target.tagName === 'TEXTAREA') {
      return;
    }

    // Handle shortcuts
