# Subscription Cancellation Fix

## Problem Description

When reception staff cancelled a user's subscription plan, the system would set the subscription status to 'cancelled' but would leave the `remaining_classes` field intact. This caused an issue where cancelled subscriptions with remaining classes would still appear as "active" in the mobile app.

### Root Cause

The `/api/subscriptions/current` endpoint uses this logic:
```sql
WHERE us.status = 'active' OR (us.status = 'cancelled' AND us.remaining_classes > 0)
```

This means cancelled subscriptions with `remaining_classes > 0` would still be returned as the user's "current" subscription, causing the app to show an active subscription instead of "No Active Subscription".

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes

**File: `backend/routes/subscriptions.js`**

Updated the cancellation endpoint (`PUT /api/subscriptions/:id/cancel`) to:

1. **Clear remaining classes** when cancelling:
   ```sql
   UPDATE user_subscriptions 
   SET status = "cancelled", remaining_classes = 0, updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
   WHERE id = ?
   ```

2. **Enhanced activity logging** to record cleared classes:
   ```javascript
   `Subscription cancelled by ${req.user.role}. ${subscription.remaining_classes > 0 ? `${subscription.remaining_classes} remaining classes cleared.` : ''} Reason: ${reason}`
   ```

### Impact

- ✅ **Fixed Issue**: Cancelled subscriptions no longer appear as "active" in the app
- ✅ **User Experience**: Users now see "No Active Subscription" correctly after cancellation
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: Prevents booking attempts on cancelled subscriptions
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Activity logs now record how many classes were cleared during cancellation

### Testing

The fix was tested and confirmed to work correctly:

1. **Before Fix**: Cancelled subscriptions with `remaining_classes > 0` would still appear as current
2. **After Fix**: Cancelled subscriptions with `remaining_classes = 0` no longer appear as current
3. **API Behavior**: `/api/subscriptions/current` now correctly returns `null` for cancelled subscriptions

## Deployment Notes

## User Story Resolution

**Issue**: User "argjend" still saw active subscription after cancelling all plans
**Resolution**: 
1. Fixed existing data using database scripts 
2. Updated cancellation logic to prevent future occurrences
3. User should now see "No Active Subscription" after pull-to-refresh or app restart
