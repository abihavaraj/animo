# How to Unassign Clients from Instructors

## Where to Find This Feature

**Reception Dashboard** → **Client Management** (sidebar) → **User Management Table**

## How to Unassign a Client

1. **Go to User Management**: 
   - From Reception Dashboard, click "Client Management" in the sidebar
   - This opens the User Management interface

2. **Find the Client**: 
   - Search for the client by name, email, or phone
   - Or scroll through the list to find the client

3. **Locate Unassign Button**: 
   - In the client's row, look for the **orange person-remove icon** (👤-)
   - This button is next to the assign button (person-add icon)
   - **Note**: The unassign button only appears if the client is currently assigned to an instructor

4. **Click Unassign**: 
   - Click the orange person-remove button
   - A confirmation dialog will appear

5. **Confirm**: 
   - Confirm that you want to unassign the client from their current instructor
   - The system will tell you which instructor they were assigned to

## Visual Guide

### Button Icons:
- **👥** (card-membership) = Assign Subscription
- **👤+** (person-add) = Assign to Instructor  
- **👤-** (person-remove) = **Unassign from Instructor** ← Only visible if assigned
- **→** (arrow-forward) = Convert Prospect (if applicable)

### Button Colors:
- **Green**: Assign Subscription
- **Brown**: Assign to Instructor
- **Orange**: **Unassign from Instructor** ← This is the one
- **Red**: Convert Prospect

## What Happens When You Unassign

1. **Current Assignment Check**: System checks if client is currently assigned to an instructor
2. **No Assignment**: If client isn't assigned to anyone, you'll get a message saying "This client is not currently assigned to any instructor"
3. **Successful Unassignment**: If assigned, you'll see "ClientName has been unassigned from instructor InstructorName"
4. **Activity Log**: The unassignment is logged in the reception recent activity
5. **Instructor Access**: The instructor will no longer see this client in their "My Clients" list

## Notes

- Only clients can be unassigned (not instructors or admin users)
- This removes the general instructor-client assignment relationship
- This is different from unassigning a client from a specific class
- The client can still be re-assigned to the same or different instructor later
- All historical data and progress tracking remains intact
